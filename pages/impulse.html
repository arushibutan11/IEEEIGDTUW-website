   <p>Impulse  is the annual science and technology festival of IEEE IGDTUW STUDENT BRANCH. It also refers to the independent body of students who organize this event along with many other social initiatives and outreach programs round the year. Started in 1998 with the aim of providing a platform for the  student community to develop and showcase their technical prowess, it has now grown into the one of the  largest college technical festival in all of delhi. It is among the very few student organisations to have received patronage  for promotion of technical know-how as well as taking up social causes through ideate competitions and other initiatives over the years.</p>

			<p>The aim of IMPULSE is to foster a scientific temperament among the students through different means to cater to all kinds of talent. It ignites the spark of technical competitiveness amongst students. Our vision has been to bring science and technology to the masses and to inspire them to achieve the unexpected by providing them with a platform to showcase their skills.</p>
			
			<p>The activities culminate in a grand two day festival event in the month of march  within the campus of IGDTUW  which attracts students  from all over India including  academia, corporates and the general public </p>
			<p>The underlying spirit of the competitions was "Technology is fun" a motto that has been followed by every fest ever since.IMPULSE also set the broad outlines of Techfest in the form of competitions, lectures, workshops and exhibitions which went on to become a standard featured Event</p>
		     <ul>
            <p><strong>The plethora of activities undertaken by the Techfest team during its two day fiesta are categorized as follows:</strong></p>
			<li><strong>Competitions</strong></li>
			<p>Competitions serve the backbone for fulfilling the basic motto of IMPULSE spreading science and technology. Through its diverse and world class problem statements, competitions at IMPULSE provide a benchmark for students to gauge themselves. They have also been instrumental in making students aware of the latest technical advancements and using them as well, be it the Micromouse, car running on IC engine, Robotics or Remote Control Vehicle development. </p>
			<li><strong>Robowars</strong></li>
			<p>Impulse organizes Robowars . With an enclosed arena and precise set of rules, opposing robots battle it out one-on-one in one of the most popular and thrilling events during the festival every year .</p>
			<li><strong>Workshops</strong></li>
			<p>Workshops serve as an iron hand in fulfilling IMPULSE vision of bringing the students face to face with the latest technology that is storming the world. These workshops are organized under expert guidance from various fields and are known to attract a lot of students owing to their repute and quality content. Over the past few years workshops in Android App Development, Ethical Hacking, r-Hex Robot (all terrain six legged robot), Special Effects, Digital Photography, Humanoid Hand, Artificial Intelligence, and Bioinformatics have given an enriching experience of “Learning by Doing”.</p></ul>
