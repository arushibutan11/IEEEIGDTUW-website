			<p>The IEEE IGDTUW Student Branch is a student branch registered under the Delhi Section with more than 70 student members. It covers Branch Administration, Branch Operations, Membership, Fundraising, Professional Awareness Activities and detailed description of the awards and achievements for students. It is meant to be a reference tool and is  made available to everyone who is interested.</p>
			<p>IEEE IGDTUW Student Branch aims to make every student here  to contribute her own bit to science and tehnology. IEEE Student Branch was born with the vision to give students the opportunity to meet and learn from fellow students, as well as faculty members and professionals in the field.</p>
            <p>We  believe in building technology for people and people for technology. The branch activities offer numerous educational, technical, and professional opportunities through various events.IEEE is now no more simply limited to the electrical and electronics world but has spread its wings to every corner of the scientific magnanimity.</p>
			<p>IEEE  IGDTUW thus encourages people from diverse fields to come up and join the group for a greater cause. The mission of IEEE is to successfully promote the engineering profession for the betterment of the humanity. Among the few benefits of IEEE membership are the annual subscription of IEEE Spectrum, career opportunities at IEEE Job site, discounts with as much as 50% off at IEEE Conference registration, network with others in the local member community, having an IEEE mail id and many more. Membership helps to develop better interaction among the scientific community and promote technology career awareness among young people throughout the world. It binds them with a common chain to achieve the IEEE mission. </p>
           <p>IEEE IGDTUW membership is much more than simply getting informed about the latest innovation in your field. It's about networking with the scientific domain, interacting with great peoples, empowering professional development and taking personal responsibility to keep the IEEE banner high. Being a member of the IEEE IGDTUW Membership Promotion section I would request students from various engineering disciplines to come up and be a member of such an elite group to ultimately support the IEEE mission. Community service in its ideal form is a way of doing something positive for the community. It is a way of making the community a better place for everyone. Serving in community addresses many grass roots problems that fall through the cracks of government and social agencies. As well as, it takes away from the problems that exist in the society and in the world as a whole.</p>
		    <p>With a hope of fulfilling these aspects, IEEE IGTUW conducts various training and awareness programs to the community within the vicinity of the institution. The club ensures and facilitates the service to the society with the potentials in terms of technical assistance, health camps, book donations, teaching outreach programs, etc. </p>
		   <p>Peer to peer learning in a networked environment is a trend which is gaining popularity among young professionals and peer groups with similar research interests. IEEE is an organization promoting networked interactions among engineering professionals is passively helping in building up these interactions in local groups.</p>
		   <p>Education in its broadest sense is any act or experience that has a formative effect on the mind, character and physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense education is the process by which society transmits its accumulated knowledge, skills and values over generations.</p>
		   <p>There has been an increasing awareness of individuals being looked upon as valuable resources of society. Keeping in pace with this thought, IEEE IGDTUW  Student CT conducts various workshops and technical conferences for people to interact and pass their knowledge onto others.</p>
		   <p><strong>Some of our activities include:</strong><ul>
<li>Development of  Website.</li>
<li>Member management on a unified platform.</li>
<li>Strategic efforts for publicity of Workshops, conferences, guest lectures and industrial trips.</li>
<li>Collaborations with other IEEE  Student Chapters and Clubs.</li></ul>
